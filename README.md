# Endless Sky Plugin: Spacefarer

This is a plugin for the free open source game: [Endless Sky][ES].  The theme
song for this plugin is [The Wanderer][the-wanderer].

# Gameplay Mechanics Changes

In an effort to add a unique re-playable experience to Endless Sky this plugin
aims to minimally change the vanilla experience except to place a few
constraints upon the player.

Constraints include:

- Outfits cannot be looted (except for when a mission calls for it)
- Ships cannot be captured
- Critical story elements grant necessary outfits and ships as mission rewards

# Known issues

- Outfits are not plunderable but cargo on a ship can still be plundered.  This
  is a limitation in what can be accomplished in plugins.  We accept this as a
  limitation and have no plans to change it.
- Because Jump Drives are not plunderable there's critical story elements
  inaccessible.  We're working on addressing this issue.
  - Sheragi
  - Wanderer
  - Syndicate Checkmate
- Some story elements require plundering outfits.  Right now we've enabled
  plundering those specific outfits all the time.  An enhancement will be to
  toggle plunder only when necessary.
