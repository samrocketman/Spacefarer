# Endless Sky Plugin: Spacefarer 3000

This is a plugin for the free open source game: [Endless Sky][ES].

The theme song for this plugin is [The Wanderer][the-wanderer]

Mechanics
---------

In an effort to add a unique re-playable experience to Endless Sky this plugin aims to minimally change the vanilla experience except to place a few constraints upon the player.

Constraints include:

- No outfits can be looted.
- Ships cannot be captured.
- Ships and outfits can only be purchased.
- Critical story elements grant necessary outfits and ships as mission rewards.

# Known issues

- Outfits are not plunderable but cargo on a ship can still be plundered.  This
  is a limitation in what can be accomplished in plugins.  We accept this as a
  limitation and have no plans to change it.
- Because Jump Drives are not plunderable there's critical story elements
  inaccessible.  We're working on addressing this issue.
