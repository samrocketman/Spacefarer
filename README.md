**Alpha:** critical story elements are broken due to being unable to loot
outfits from disabled ships.  However, we're playing through it and will address
the issues as we hit them.

- Free worlds missions broken
- Because Jump Drives are not plunderable there's critical story elements
  inaccessible.  We're working on addressing this issue.

  - Wanderer
  - Syndicate Checkmate

# Gameplay Mechanics Changes

In an effort to add a unique re-playable experience to Endless Sky this plugin
aims to minimally change the vanilla experience except to place a few
constraints upon the player.

Constraints include:

- Outfits cannot be looted (except for when a mission calls for it)
- Ships cannot be captured
- Critical story elements grant necessary outfits and ships as mission rewards

# Known issues

- Critical story elements.  See Development status section.
- Outfits are not plunderable but cargo on a ship can still be plundered.  This
  is a limitation in what can be accomplished in plugins.  We accept this as a
  limitation and have no plans to change it.
