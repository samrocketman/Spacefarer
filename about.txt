Welcome to Spacefarer
As a captain, you're careful not to risk the lives of your crew with frivolous combat.  Loss of life is inevitable in the merciless deep reaches of space.  You stick to the honest life ferrying and ship to ship combat.  If anyone is going to die, it will be everyone when the ship explodes.
